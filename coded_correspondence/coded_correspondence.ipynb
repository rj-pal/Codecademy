    "In this project, you will be working to code and decode various messages between you and your fictional cryptography enthusiast pen pal Vishal. You and Vishal have been exchanging letters for quite some time now and have started to provide a puzzle in each one of your letters.  Here is his most recent letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a  Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something like \"hello\" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of \"hello\", I would code my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left (with respect to the alphabet). So \"h\" becomes \"e\", \"e\" becomes, \"b\", \"l\" becomes \"i\", and \"o\" becomes \"l\". Then I have my coded message,\"ebiil\"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer coded message that you have to decode yourself!\n",

    "            Salutations! As you can see, technology has made brute forcing simple ciphers like the Caesar Cipher extremely easy, and us crypto-enthusiasts have had to get more creative and use more complicated ciphers. This next cipher I'm going to teach you is the Vigenère Cipher, invented by an Italian cryptologist named Giovan Battista Bellaso (cool name eh?) in the 16th century, but named after another cryptologist from the 16th century, Blaise de Vigenère.\n",
    "            \n",
    "           The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, as opposed to the Caesar Cipher which was a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. What this means is that opposed to having a single shift that is applied to every letter, the Vigenère Cipher has a different shift for each individual letter. The value of the shift for each letter is determined by a given keyword.\n",
    "           \n",
    "           Consider the message\n",
    "           \n",
    "               barry is the spy\n",
    "\n",
    "           If we want to code this message, first we choose a keyword. For this example, we'll use the keyword\n",
    "           \n",
    "               dog\n",
    "               \n",
    "           Now we use the repeat the keyword over and over to generate a _keyword phrase_ that is the same length as the message we want to code. So if we want to code the message \"barry is the spy\" our _keyword phrase_ is \"dogdo gd ogd ogd\". Now we are ready to start coding our message. We shift the each letter of our message by the place value of the corresponding letter in the keyword phrase, assuming that \"a\" has a place value of 0, \"b\" has a place value of 1, and so forth. Remember, we zero-index because this is Python we're talking about!\n",
    "\n",
    "                        message:       b  a  r  r  y    i  s   t  h  e   s  p  y\n",
    "                \n",
    "                 keyword phrase:       d  o  g  d  o    g  d   o  g  d   o  g  d\n",
    "                 \n",
    "          resulting place value:       4  14 15 12 16   24 11  21 25 22  22 17 5\n",
    "      \n",
    "            So we shift \"b\", which has an index of 1, by the index of \"d\", which is 3. This gives us an place value of 4, which is \"e\". Then continue the trend: we shift \"a\" by the place value of \"o\", 14, and get \"o\" again, we shift \"r\" by the place value of \"g\", 15, and get \"x\", shift the next \"r\" by 12 places and \"u\", and so forth. Once we complete all the shifts we end up with our coded message:\n",

    "                \n",
    "            As you can imagine, this is a lot harder to crack without knowing the keyword! So now comes the hard part. I'll give you a message and the keyword, and you'll see if you can figure out how to crack it! Ready? Okay here's my message:\n",
    "            \n",

    "           \n",
    "And there it is. Vishal has given you quite the assignment this time! Try to decode his message. It may be helpful to create a function that takes two parameters, the coded message and the keyword and then work towards a solution from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Watch out for spaces and punctuation! When there's a space or punctuation mark in the original message, there should be a space/punctuation mark in the corresponding repeated-keyword string as well! "
